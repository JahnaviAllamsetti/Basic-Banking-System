# Basic-Banking-System
This is a sparks task file for creating a basic banking website
In this project I have created a basic banking system and hosted it with the help of xampp. First I have created and populated my customers table with 10 entries each containing details like name, email-id, phone number and account balance.In my home page I have a button which takes the user to view all the customers and here for each customer we can either view their details or transfer money to other customer. when you select to transfer money have to select the recipient and also you cna't enter money more than that in the account of our user. Once the transaction is sucessful an alert will be generated saying transaction sucessful.Now if you open view all customers page you can notice the changes in balances. This also has a transactions page which will show all the transactions that have been happened.
